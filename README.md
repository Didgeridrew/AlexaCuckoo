# AlexaCuckoo
Cuckoo Clock for Alexa: Plays cuckoos for the number of the hour on the hour, and 1 cuckoo on the half hour.

This automation relies on the [Alexa Media Player](https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player) integration.

Modified for Alexa from [@CCOSTAN's CucKoo_Clock](https://github.com/CCOSTAN/Home-AssistantConfig/blob/master/config/automation/System/CucKoo_Clock.yaml)
